# MOOC_FI_RecipeSearch
In this exercise we are going to create a program that allows for searching for recipes based on their name, cooking time, or the name of an ingredient. The program should read the recipes from a file that the user provides. It might be a good idea to brush up on reading information from files (part 4) before beginning

Each recipe consists of three or more rows in a recipe file. The first row is for the name of the recipe, the second the cooking time (an integer), and the third and possibly following rows list the ingredients used in the recipe. An empty row follows the last ingredient row. There can be many recipes in a single file. Below, an example file containing recipes is described.
